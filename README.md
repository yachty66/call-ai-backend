## outreach:

our goal is it to find two customers which are interested in having us automate their call center. for this we need to define what our ideal customer looks like - ie we can either reach out to existing call centers or we can reach out directly to the car dealerships

cold call a bunch of dealership and ask them if they are interested in becoming a partner with us

instead of quantity we should maybe really focus on quality instead. once we have the demo we can just share it in our outreach email
